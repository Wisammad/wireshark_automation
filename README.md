Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning
This project implements a network traffic anomaly detection system leveraging machine learning. It processes .pcap files captured using Wireshark, extracts meaningful features, and classifies traffic as normal or anomalous.

Features
üìÑ Feature Extraction: Parses .pcap files to extract attributes like protocol, flags, packet length, and more.
üõ†Ô∏è Synthetic Data Generation: Augments the dataset with realistic attack simulations (e.g., SYN floods, Nmap scans) and natural network noise.
ü§ñ Machine Learning Model: A Random Forest classifier trained on a mix of synthetic and real-world data to detect anomalies.
üîÑ Real-Time Detection: Processes live network traffic in specified intervals for real-time anomaly identification.
Technologies Used
PyShark: For packet capture and feature extraction.
Pandas: For data preprocessing and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling.
Wireshark: For network traffic capture.
